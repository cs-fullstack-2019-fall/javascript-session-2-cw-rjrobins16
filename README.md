## Enhancing Existing Applications - Session 4

For this mini-project you are provided a mostly working application. A simple console version of a Calculator is already provided in this git repository.

Your challenge is to implemented a series of enhancements after testing and looking through the existing code.

#### Do not use Google and try to refrain from revisiting your past code for this assignment!

### Enhancement Exercises: All areas in the code with enhancements requested are marked with TODO comments
1. In main application code, add code needed to use the existing class methods ```subtract``` and ```clear_calculation_result()``` 

2. Implement a new class method to perform multiplication operations, and add support for multiplication to your main application code
3. Implement a new class method to perform division operations, and add support for multiplication to your main application code

4. Add any additional code needed in your main application code so that the user can continue performing calculations until they enter 'x' to exit.

* Don't forget to update existing input prompts and output messages to reflect your enhancements.
